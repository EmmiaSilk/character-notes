We enter the castle courtyard and talk to the town's leaders, Governor Nighthill and Castellan Escobert. Because he recognizes our immense combat skill as first level adventurers, Escobert asks us to open up a the exit of a secret tunnel under the keep to allow easy access in and out of the castle. We agree to help out, since preventing the town from getting overrun will help us to eventually not die. Escobert warns us that there may be rats in the tunnel, and that we need to find a key (likely somewhere in the tunnel) to open it.

As we pass through the subterranean tunnel, we cross by a horde of sleeping rats. We tiptoe past them, careful to avoid waking them up. But as we search through the tunnel, one of our party-members accidentally steps too close to a rat. It wasn't me though, because I can fly. The rats begin waking up all at once, squeaking and skittering around. With that, combat begins.

This isn't really a fight that needs to be talked about though, since it's just a bunch of rats, and rats are an easy victory for us!

After defeating the rats, one of us finds the key and uses it to unlock the tunnel. Then we step outside, but as we open the gate we startle a bunch of kobolds and cultists behind it! Once again, we are locked in deadly combat with these bad guys. As our foes focus their attacks on my allies, I focus my efforts on protecting my companions with my shield. It's a tough battle, but we make it through because I'm just so agile and skilled at protecting others.

When the battle is over, some of us are a little battered, but at least we're all still standing. We take a moment to breathe, planning to head back into the keep... But then we hear the roar of an unfamiliar creature nearby. We ready our blades as a new group of enemies approaches...

**SESSION END**

We earned another 80 experience this session, ending up with exactly 300. This is just enough to level up to level 2, so now Lilah is a super cool super strong fairy fighter. Yay!
