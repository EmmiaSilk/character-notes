# The LeStarr System
Hiya! We are the LeStarr system. We are a plural system with dissociative
identity disorder, just trying to enjoy life and get by in the world. Age is
complicated, but our body is 23 as of 2021. We are also transgender, with a
majority of our alters being women or girls.

We share a Toyhouse account ([EmmiaSilk](https://toyhou.se/EmmiaSilk)) where we keep
information about and art of some of our characters, although not everyone is
on there.

## Emmia Silk

Our host is Emmia. That's me! I'm the one who fronts most often and most
publicly. My pronouns are She/Her. I like fighting games, co-operative gaming
and storytelling, and roleplay games such as Dungeons and Dragons.

I have a twitter account ([@EmmiaSilk](https://twitter.com/EmmiaSilk)) for general use, as
well as a second account ([@NieraGrail](https://twitter.com/NieraGrail)) for my
vampire v-tuber alter ego.
