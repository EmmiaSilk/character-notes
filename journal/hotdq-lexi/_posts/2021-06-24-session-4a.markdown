As we plot how we are going to deal with the situation in the mill, we hear a loud thump on the roof of the keep above us. We exit the keep to investigate, and we realize that the big adult dragon we saw earlier in the day has landed on the keep. Soldiers and civilians alike man the nearby ballistae, and the *real heroes* attack from afar with their weapons.

Being the great warrior that I am, I point out a nearby unmanned ballista to Kosilius. Then I fly to the dragon and attack it up close. I know it's dangerous, but I want to protect the people I am fighting with, and fighting is all I know. I slash at the dragon with my longsword...

Then the dragon turns toward me and opens its mouth. I see a flash of blue light, then nothing. I feel the air rushing past my body as I fall, fall, fall from the sky. Everything goes cold and numb.

**LILAH END??**

I awaken in a pile of leaves in the forests of the Feywild. The world is serene and blissful. There's no kobolds to fight, no dragons to kill me... But also no Kosilius to feed, and no Throk Woodhand to smith runes with.

Is this really where I want to be? In the world of my people?

It doesn't matter anymore. This is where I am, and this is where I will stay for the rest of eternity.

*Goodbye, Kosilius.*
