The mage asserted herself without warning, wearing the robes of the enemy and
wielding nothing more than a crossbow in hand. Her shots rang out with a crack
as she struck her former allies, now foes, with bolts of eldritch power.

It's time for Mercury Wolfhound to take her destiny and freedom into her own
hands.

## Personality and Backstory
Mercury used to be a member of the Cult of the Dragon, having recently
defected, taking her drake Ailith with her. She seems quite unfriendly with
others.

## Appearance
Mercury's hair is a natural blonde, always tied back. Her skin is warm ivory in
tone, and mostly unmarked by scars. Her gray eyes are devoid of any light. Her
lips and eyes convey a neutral expression. Overall, mercury is a depressing
sight to behold.

Like other members of the Cult of the Dragon, Mercury wears purple robes. Under
these robes is a dark coat, which itself is worn over a dark red undershirt.
Her rather large breasts are always kept under binding. Her black trousers and
leather boots protect her from the environment while simultaneously keeping her
body hidden from others.
