Like her parents before her, Arlee Summers has found herself a participant in
Lethal Examination, this time in Tartarus. With her overly-protective father as
an ally, Arlee must do what it takes to survive and to protect her friends in a
game that seems dead-set on killing her.

Does Arlee have what it takes to survive the test? And who is the "traitor" to
Livetech that the examiners keep talking about?

<!--END_EXCERPT-->

## Personality
Arlee Summers is a cheerful girl who wants to spread her joy to everyone she
can. Arlee has always been carefully guarded against the dangers of world by
her parents, the TV announcer Morgan Summers and the "waitress" Brynlee
Summers. While many consider her naive and easily duped, Arlee makes up for her
trusting nature with physical brawn, agility, an almost encyclopedic knowledge
of certain things, and heaps of determination.

Arlee's interest in escort-work began in middle school, when a fellow student
offered to pay her to go to a dance with him. Intrigued by the offer, Arlee
accepted, and had such a fun time that she has made a career out of going on
dates, still doing so even to this day. But her duties as an escort are not
limited solely to dates-- Lately, she has branched out to match-making,
location scouting, and romantic consultation. Arlee will anything she can to
make her client happy, as long as they don't get frisky.

There are a few struggles Arlee hides behind her spirited nature. She fears
being alone, as she has almost always had someone around to keep her company
and protect her, and on some of the few occasions when she has been alone, she
has seen or experienced awful things. She also has an eating disorder, anorexia
nervosa, stemming from her fear of being alone. She has convinced herself that
if she gains weight, she will be seen as ugly, and people won't want to be
around her anymore.

Overall, Arlee Summers is an individual with room for personal growth. If she
can learn to face her fears and to question what she is told, she may grow to
be a strong woman, who can only be stopped by death itself.

## Backstory
Arlee was raised by Morgan and Brynlee Summers, both of whom have passed Lethal
Examination previously, along with Annalyn Tabacchi, a family friend. Arlee's
parents worked for LiveTech in secret, never allowing her to know of the
company or its deadly hiring practices for fear that she might become scouted
for Lethal Examination too. Growing up, Arlee never truly suspected her parents
of keeping secrets, even at the worst of times.

Since a young age, Arlee lived under a somewhat strict regimen of eating
home-cooked meals and physical training, with Brynlee experimenting with
various high-protein meals and focusing on training her strength, and other
various teachers training her in defensive combat, endurance, and speed.

Arlee's interest in escort work began in middle school, when a classmate
offered to pay her to go to the dance with him. After some deliberation, she
accepted and had a very good time. After this, Arlee realized that the life of
an escort allowed her to go on enjoyable dates with a variety of people without
needing the obligations of a long-term relationship. Still, Arlee always longed
for someone to be all her own, who she could belong with and trust.

In recent times, Arlee has struggled with her self-image, both in regards to
her reputation and her body. Fearing loneliness and abandonment, Arlee
developed an eating disorder. While Morgan was unaware of Arlee's change in
diet, Brynlee took notice and allowed an adjustment to be made to her meal
strategy: Arlee would drink more smoothies, but Brynlee would secretly prepare
them with protein powders and nutrient supplements.

Shortly before the events of the Lethal Examination in Tartarus, Arlee was made
aware of a rumor that her mother was in an affair with the family's
hairdresser, a woman named Daniela. This woman eventually turned up dead. Many
of Arlee's classmates and neighbors theorized that Brynlee killed Daniela to
cover up the affair. Arlee wanted to investigate to get to the bottom of the
murder and prove her mother's innocence. But fate had something else in store
for Arlee.

## Appearance
Arlee is a happy girl who frequently wears a bright smile on her pale ivory
face. Her indigo hair (dyed from a pale blue) is usually tied in buns, leaving
enough hair elsewhere to hang down in some places. There is a red streak in her
hair to the right of her face, matching her striking red eyes. She always wears
a red rose hairpin and a black faux-leather choker.

Her favorite outfit is an oversized brown button-up shirt over her black,
sleeveless top, both of which are cropped high, revealing her shoulders and
exposing her belly. Her brown, yoke-waist skirt reaches just above her knees,
and her black-and-red striped socks cover her shins. Her black ankle-height
biker boots with a pansexual pride charm tied into the laces complete this
punk-inspired outfit.
