Like her parents before her, Arlee Summers has found herself a participant in
Lethal Examination, this time in Tartarus. With her overly-protective father as
an ally, Arlee must do what it takes to survive and to protect her friends in a
game that seems dead-set on killing her.

Does Arlee have what it takes to survive the test? And who is the "traitor" to
Livetech that the examiners keep talking about?

## Personality
Arlee Summers is a cheerful girl who wants to spread her joy to everyone she
can. Arlee has always been carefully guarded against the dangers of world by
her parents, the TV announcer Morgan Summers and the "waitress" Brynlee
Summers. While many consider her naive and easily duped, Arlee makes up for her
trusting nature with physical brawn, agility, an almost encyclopedic knowledge
of certain things, and heaps of determination.

Arlee's interest in escort-work began in middle school, when a fellow student
offered to pay her to go to a dance with him. Intrigued by the offer, Arlee
accepted, and had such a fun time that she has made a career out of going on
dates, still doing so even to this day. But her duties as an escort are not
limited solely to dates-- Lately, she has branched out to match-making,
location scouting, and romantic consultation. Arlee will anything she can to
make her client happy, as long as they don't get frisky.

There are a few struggles Arlee hides behind her spirited nature. She fears
being alone, as she has almost always had someone around to keep her company
and protect her, and on some of the few occasions when she has been alone, she
has seen or experienced awful things. She also has an eating disorder, anorexia
nervosa, stemming from her fear of being alone. She has convinced herself that
if she gains weight, she will be seen as ugly, and people won't want to be
around her anymore.

Overall, Arlee Summers is an individual with room for personal growth. If she
can learn to face her fears and to question what she is told, she may grow to
be a strong woman, who can only be stopped by death itself.
